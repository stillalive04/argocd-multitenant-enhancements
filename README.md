# ArgoCD Multi-Tenant Enhancements

Enhancements for ArgoCD multi-tenant Kubernetes deployments with RBAC, Helm, and GitOps patterns

## Overview

This repository contains configurations and manifests to enhance ArgoCD for multi-tenant Kubernetes environments. It includes:

- **Multi-tenant RBAC policies** for secure access control
- **Helm values configurations** for different environments (dev/prod)
- **ApplicationSets** for automated blue-green and canary deployments
- **GitOps patterns** for streamlined CI/CD workflows

## Features

### üîê Multi-Tenant RBAC
- Role-based access control for different teams and environments
- Namespace isolation and resource restrictions
- Fine-grained permissions for developers and operators

### üöÄ Deployment Strategies
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback capability
- **Canary Deployments**: Gradual rollouts with traffic splitting and automated rollback

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Management
- Separate Helm configurations for development and production
- Environment-specific resource limits and scaling policies
- Configuration drift detection and remediation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (1.20+)
- ArgoCD installed and configured
- Helm 3.x
- kubectl configured with cluster access

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd argocd-multitenant-enhancements
   ```

2. **Apply RBAC policies:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f manifests/rbac-policy.yaml
   ```

3. **Deploy ApplicationSets:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f manifests/applicationset-bluegreen.yaml
   kubectl apply -f manifests/applicationset-canary.yaml
   ```

## Configuration

### Development Environment

The `helm-values-dev.yaml` includes:
- Reduced resource limits for cost optimization
- Debug logging enabled
- Development-friendly configurations

### Production Environment

The `helm-values-prod.yaml` includes:
- Production-grade resource allocations
- High availability configurations
- Security hardening settings
- Monitoring and alerting integrations

### RBAC Configuration

Multi-tenant access control with:
- **Developers**: Read/write access to specific namespaces
- **DevOps Engineers**: Cluster-wide read access, write access to system namespaces
- **Platform Admins**: Full cluster access

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployments

- **Zero downtime**: Instant traffic switching between environments
- **Quick rollback**: Immediate fallback to previous version
- **Resource intensive**: Requires double the resources during deployment

### Canary Deployments

- **Gradual rollout**: Progressive traffic shifting (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
- **Risk mitigation**: Early detection of issues with minimal impact
- **Resource efficient**: Only requires additional resources for canary version

## Monitoring and Observability

Integration points for:
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Dashboard visualization
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing
- **ArgoCD Notifications**: Slack/email alerts for deployment status

## Security Considerations

- **Network Policies**: Pod-to-pod communication restrictions
- **Pod Security Standards**: Enforced security contexts
- **Secret Management**: Integration with external secret stores
- **Image Security**: Vulnerability scanning and admission controllers

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **RBAC Permission Denied**
   - Verify ClusterRole and RoleBinding configurations
   - Check namespace permissions

2. **ApplicationSet Not Syncing**
   - Validate Git repository access
   - Check ArgoCD project permissions

3. **Deployment Failures**
   - Review resource quotas and limits
   - Verify Helm chart compatibility
